  "title": "MHC Diversity Across Time and Space: Implications for Wildlife Conservation and Disease Resistance",
  "background": "Genetic diversity, particularly in Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes, plays a crucial role in disease resistance and population adaptability. Understanding how this diversity is maintained and distributed across spatial and temporal scales provides insights into evolutionary processes and extinction risks.",
  "objective": "To review geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in natural populations and explore how selective and demographic processes shape this diversity, with implications for conservation in the face of climate change and emerging diseases.",
  "methods": "Literature review and synthesis of studies examining MHC diversity across latitudinal/altitudinal gradients, habitat fragmentation scenarios, and temporal scales using various genetic analysis techniques including amplicon sequencing and whole genome sequencing.",
  "results": "MHC diversity is often lower at species distribution edges, particularly in high-latitude and high-altitude regions. Habitat fragmentation reduces immunogenetic diversity, while parasite-mediated balancing selection maintains variation. Climate change threatens to disrupt host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics.",
  "conclusion": "Maintaining immunogenetic diversity is critical for population resilience against emerging diseases and climate change. Integrating multidisciplinary data and improving MHC characterization methods will enhance conservation efforts.",

      "note": "MHC genes are the most variable in vertebrate genomes and play crucial roles in parasite recognition, with class I targeting intracellular parasites like viruses and class II targeting extracellular parasites like bacteria. This immunogenetic diversity directly impacts disease resistance at both individual and population levels, with heterozygous individuals recognizing more antigens."

      "note": "Three main hypotheses explain parasite-mediated maintenance of MHC polymorphism: Heterozygote Advantage (broader antigen recognition), Rare Allele Advantage (frequency-dependent selection), and Fluctuating Selection (spatial/temporal variation in parasite pressure). These mechanisms collectively maintain diversity against genetic drift."

However, balancing selection can sometimes maintain functional diversity even when genome-wide diversity is lost, highlighting the importance of specific conservation strategies."
