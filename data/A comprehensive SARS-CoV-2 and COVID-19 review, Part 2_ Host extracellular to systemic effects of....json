      "note": "SARS-CoV-2 infection causes significant mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressing oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle metabolites like citrate, fumarate, and malate, while increasing glycolysis and shunting toward pentose phosphate pathways. These metabolic shifts correlate with disease severity and represent potential biomarkers for monitoring physiological stress in confined environments."
    },
    {
      "id": "LN2",
      "note": "The virus directly interacts with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) through ACE2 receptors, causing imbalance with decreased ACE and increased ACE2, renin, angiotensin, and bradykinin. This dysregulation leads to cardiovascular symptoms and could inform monitoring of cardiovascular adaptations in spaceflight conditions."

    {
      "id": "LN3",
      "note": "Exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients contain viral components and immunomodulatory molecules that can stimulate inflammatory pathways in endothelial cells. Exosomes containing ACE2 can act as decoys to inhibit viral entry, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for viral protection in isolated environments."

      "id": "LN4",
      "note": "Non-coding RNAs including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs play significant regulatory roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Circulating miRNA hsa-miR-2392 drives mitochondrial gene suppression and inflammation, while specific lncRNAs correlate with viral loads and immune responses, offering diagnostic potential."

      "id": "LN5",
      "note": "Cardiovascular adaptations include direct viral infection of endothelial cells, micro/macrovascular thrombosis, and suppression of cardiac functional markers. Autopsy studies show SARS-CoV-2 presence in myocardial tissue with decreased expression of TNNI3, TNNT2, and other cardiac markers despite no histological changes."

      "id": "LN6",
      "note": "Immune dysregulation involves both innate and adaptive systems, with neutrophil activation, NETosis, type I interferon signaling disruption, and lymphopenia. Severe COVID-19 shows elevated IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α with increased NF-κB activity, while airway inflammation shows different cytokine patterns than systemic circulation."
