  "title": "Altered quorum sensing and physiology of Staphylococcus aureus during spaceflight detected by multi-omics data analysis",
  "background": "Staphylococcus aureus is a significant human pathogen that colonizes approximately 30% of humans and poses health risks to astronauts during spaceflight missions. Previous studies have shown S. aureus can be recovered from astronauts at higher numbers post-flight, and staphylococci are predominant microbes aboard the ISS.",
  "objective": "To analyze the response of S. aureus to the spaceflight environment using multi-omics approaches to understand alterations in physiology and virulence potential.",
  "methods": "Multi-omics analysis of RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, metabolomics, and secretomics data from the BRIC-23 spaceflight experiment comparing asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures grown for 48 hours at ISS ambient temperature (~22째C) using Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units.",
  "results": "Spaceflight cultures showed significant upregulation of Agr quorum sensing system (RNAIII upregulated 88-fold), increased expression of virulence factors (proteases, toxins, Type VII secretion system), altered metabolism (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, urease activity), and decreased glycolysis/fermentation. FLT cultures achieved higher cell densities with 30% less secreted protein concentration.",
  "conclusion": "S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential for astronauts during long-duration missions.",
