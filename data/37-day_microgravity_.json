  "title": "37-Day microgravity exposure in 16-Week female C57BL/6J mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites",
  "background": "Spaceflight causes bone loss through complex mechanisms including increased osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblast inhibition. Previous studies show variable effects on bone mass due to experimental limitations, with incomplete recovery observed in astronauts even one year post-flight. The NASA RR-1 mission standardized conditions using the Rodent Habitat to better understand bone loss mechanisms.",
  "objective": "To determine whether spaceflight-induced bone loss is primarily due to mechanical unloading versus systemic factors like radiation by comparing weight-bearing (femur) versus muscle-loaded (spine) skeletal sites in mice during late skeletal maturation.",
  "methods": "16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 37 days of microgravity on the ISS. Analysis included Safranin-O staining for cartilage and microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT) of femur and L2 vertebrae. Experimental groups included spaceflight (FL), ground controls in Rodent Habitats (GC), vivarium controls (VIV), and baseline controls (BL). Statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test and paired t-tests.",
  "results": "Significant bone loss occurred specifically in weight-bearing femoral sites: femoral head BV/TV decreased 25-27%, distal epiphysis BV/TV decreased 55%. Flight bones showed fewer, thinner trabeculae with increased separation. No significant changes occurred in L2 vertebrae. Spaceflight accelerated secondary endochondral ossification (SEO) in femoral heads with 50% ossification rate versus controls. Rodent Habitat housing promoted bone maintenance compared to standard vivarium cages.",
  "conclusion": "Mechanical unloading of weight-bearing skeletal sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while muscle-loaded sites like the spine remain unaffected. Space radiation in LEO (7.4 mGy over 37 days) is insufficient to cause systemic bone loss. The habitat topology influences physical activity and bone loading patterns.",
