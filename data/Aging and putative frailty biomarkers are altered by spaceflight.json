  "title": "Aging and putative frailty biomarkers are altered by spaceflight",
  "background": "Space exploration poses significant health risks to astronauts, causing molecular changes similar to aging processes on Earth. These include genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and homeostatic dysregulation. Frailty syndrome, associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively studied during spaceflight.",
  "objective": "To assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia in the spaceflight context using multi-omics approaches.",
  "methods": "Analysis of murine data from NASA's GeneLab, astronaut data from JAXA missions, and Inspiration4 mission data. Methods included differential gene expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), metabolic flux simulation, and single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMCs.",
  "results": "Spaceflight induces changes in frailty-related gene expression patterns in both rodents and humans. Key findings include altered expression of genes related to inflammation, muscle wasting, and metabolic pathways. Interferon response pathways were consistently upregulated, and several gene expression changes persisted after return to Earth.",
  "conclusion": "Spaceflight induces molecular changes consistent with accelerated aging and frailty development. These findings suggest the potential utility of a frailty index for monitoring astronaut health during long-duration missions.",
