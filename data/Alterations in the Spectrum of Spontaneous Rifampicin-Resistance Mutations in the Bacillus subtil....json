  "title": "Alterations in the Spectrum of Spontaneous Rifampicin-Resistance Mutations in the Bacillus subtilis rpoB Gene after Cultivation in the Human Spaceflight Environment",
  "background": "Spaceflight presents unique physical stressors including cosmic radiation, microgravity, vibration, electromagnetic fields, and altered atmospheric compositions that may affect microbial mutagenesis and evolution.",
  "objective": "To investigate the effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceflight environment on growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) in the rpoB gene.",
  "methods": "B. subtilis cells were cultivated in Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) on two separate ISS missions (BRIC-18 and BRIC-21) with matching asynchronous ground controls. RifR mutants were isolated and rpoB gene regions sequenced to determine mutation spectra.",
  "results": "No significant differences in growth or RifR mutation frequency were found between flight and ground samples. However, dramatic differences in mutation spectra were observed, including two novel rpoB alleles (Q137R and L489S) exclusively in flight samples.",
  "conclusion": "Exposure to the human spaceflight environment causes unique stresses on bacteria, leading to alterations in their mutagenic potential and potentially affecting microbial evolution in space habitats.",
