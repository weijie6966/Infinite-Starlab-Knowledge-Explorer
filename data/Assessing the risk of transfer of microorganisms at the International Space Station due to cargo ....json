  "title": "Assessing the Risk of Transfer of Microorganisms at the International Space Station Due to Cargo Delivery by Commercial Resupply Vehicles",
  "background": "With increasing interplanetary missions, robust protocols are needed to protect extraterrestrial planets from contamination by terrestrial life forms. This study compares commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) microbiome with ISS microbiome to understand contamination risks.",
  "objective": "To determine if CRV systems could be a source of microbial contamination of the ISS by characterizing microbial diversity of CRV prior to launch",
  "methods": "Samples from internal surfaces and ground support equipment of three CRV missions were analyzed using cultivation assays, ATP assays, qPCR, and shotgun metagenome sequencing. Comparison was made with previously reported ISS microbiome data.",
  "results": "CRV internal surfaces were clean with order of magnitude fewer microbes than ground support equipment. CRV1 had larger microbial population than subsequent missions. Metagenome comparison revealed significant differences between CRV and ISS microbiomes, with CRV microbiomes being negligible part of ISS environmental microbiome.",
  "conclusion": "Cleaning protocols for CRV surfaces are highly effective in controlling contaminating microbial population during cargo transfer to ISS, showing very little risk of microorganism transfer via CRV transport.",
