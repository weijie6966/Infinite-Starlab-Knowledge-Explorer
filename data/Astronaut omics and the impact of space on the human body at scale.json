      "note": "Pharmacogenomic analysis showed that 24 of the 78 standard medications permanently available on the ISS are significantly affected by individual genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP450, highlighting the need for personalized pharmaceutical regimens during space missions to account for variations in drug metabolism efficiency among crew members."
