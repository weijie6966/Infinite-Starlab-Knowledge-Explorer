  "title": "A New Role of NAP1L1 in Megakaryocytes and Human Platelets",
  "background": "Platelets are anucleate cells traditionally considered incapable of nuclear functions, yet they contain nuclear proteins. The functional roles of these proteins in platelets and their megakaryocyte precursors remain largely unexplored, particularly in the context of systemic inflammatory conditions like sepsis.",
  "objective": "To investigate the expression, interaction partners, and functional roles of nuclear assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1) in human platelets and CD34+-derived megakaryocytes, with specific focus on sepsis-related changes.",
  "methods": "RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity assays, NAP1L1 overexpression in megakaryocytes, and proplatelet formation assays.",
  "results": "NAP1L1 is expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes as multiple transcript variants and protein isoforms. NAP1L1 directly interacts with PDC-E2, a key mitochondrial enzyme. Sepsis increases NAP1L1 expression and PDH activity in platelets, while NAP1L1 overexpression in megakaryocytes reduces proplatelet formation and PDH activity under LPS stimulation.",
  "conclusion": "NAP1L1 performs non-nuclear functions in platelets and megakaryocytes, interacting with mitochondrial proteins to influence energy metabolism and thrombopoiesis, with differential regulation during sepsis that may contribute to sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia.",
