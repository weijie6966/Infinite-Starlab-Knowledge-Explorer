  "background": "Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system due to microgravity, radiation, and other environmental stressors. Understanding neurological responses and developing countermeasures is critical for future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.",
  "objective": "To investigate CNS changes in Drosophila exposed to spaceflight conditions and evaluate artificial gravity as a countermeasure for neurological deficits",
  "methods": "ISS-based study using MVP-Fly-01 hardware with inflight centrifugation (SF1g vs SFμg), behavioral analysis, brain immunohistochemistry, transcriptomics, proteomics, and postflight acclimation assessment",
  "results": "Artificial gravity provided partial protection against spaceflight-induced neurological deficits. SFμg flies showed hyperactivity, climbing defects, neuronal loss, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, while SF1g flies showed fewer immediate deficits but developed delayed neurological changes during Earth acclimation.",
  "conclusion": "Artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from adverse spaceflight effects, but long-term solutions combining multiple countermeasures are needed for deep space missions.",

      "note": "The MVP-Fly-01 mission utilized specialized hardware with dual centrifuges on the ISS, allowing direct comparison between microgravity (SFμg) and artificial Earth gravity (SF1g) conditions while controlling for other spaceflight stressors. This innovative approach enabled isolation of gravity effects from radiation and other environmental factors, providing high-quality data on artificial gravity efficacy."

      "note": "Artificial gravity provided significant but incomplete protection against neurological deficits. SF1g flies showed similar brain morphology to Earth controls immediately postflight, but developed delayed neurological changes during 25-day Earth acclimation, including increased apoptosis (39% in SF1g vs 70% in SFμg) and glial depletion, suggesting artificial gravity offers short-term but not long-term protection."

      "note": "Spaceflight induced widespread metabolic reprogramming, with proteomics revealing alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. These changes were more pronounced in SFμg than SF1g conditions, indicating gravity plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism during spaceflight."

      "note": "Microgravity exposure caused significant oxidative damage, with SFμg flies showing increased 8-oxo-dG positive cells (indicating DNA oxidation) and elevated heat shock protein expression. Artificial gravity completely suppressed oxidative damage markers in SF1g flies immediately postflight, highlighting its protective role against space-induced oxidative stress."

      "note": "Behavioral analysis revealed microgravity-induced hyperactivity during spaceflight and significant climbing defects postflight, particularly in male flies. SFμg males showed more severe climbing deficits and greater dopaminergic neuron loss than females, indicating sex-specific vulnerability to spaceflight neurological effects."

      "note": "The study developed novel automated behavioral analysis using maximum intensity projections of video recordings to quantify fly activity during spaceflight. This methodology overcame limitations of manual analysis and provided objective measures of microgravity effects on behavior in the constrained ISS environment."

      "note": "Postflight acclimation revealed progressive neurological deterioration in space-reared flies, with SF1g and SFμg flies showing increased apoptosis, neuronal loss, and glial aggregation (rosette formation) over 25 days. This suggests spaceflight exposure induces latent neurological damage that manifests after return to Earth gravity."
