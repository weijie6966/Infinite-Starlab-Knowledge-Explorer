  "title": "Phosphoinositides control the localization of HOPS subunit VPS41, which together with VPS33 mediates vacuole fusion in plants",
  "background": "Plant vacuoles are essential organelles occupying up to 90% of cell volume and play critical roles in stomata movements, protein storage, gravity sensing, and ion homeostasis. Vacuole fusion is mediated by SNARE and HOPS complexes, but HOPS function in plants is not well characterized.",
  "objective": "To characterize the role of HOPS complex subunits VPS41 and VPS33 in plant vacuole fusion and determine how phosphoinositides regulate their membrane recruitment and function.",
  "methods": "Reverse genetics using Arabidopsis mutants, fluorescent protein tagging and localization, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), in vitro lipid-protein binding assays, liposome binding assays, and dexamethasone-inducible amiRNA silencing.",
  "results": "VPS41 localizes to tonoplast and late endosomes while VPS33 is primarily endosomal. Both proteins bind phosphoinositides but their membrane binding is inhibited by PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 in liposomes. HOPS is essential for pollen fertility and vacuole fusion, with VPS33 directly interacting with SNARE protein SYP22.",
  "conclusion": "Plant HOPS mediates vacuole fusion through conserved VPS33-SYP22 interactions but exhibits plant-specific phosphoinositide regulation where these lipids inhibit rather than promote membrane recruitment, representing a unique adaptation in plant vacuole dynamics.",
