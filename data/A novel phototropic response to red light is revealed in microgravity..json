  "title": "A Novel Blue-Light Phototropic Response is Revealed in Roots of Arabidopsis thaliana in Microgravity",
  "background": "Plants use environmental cues like light and gravity for orientation and growth movements (tropisms). On Earth, gravity masks certain phototropic responses, making it difficult to study 'pure' phototropism. Understanding plant growth in microgravity and fractional gravity is essential for space agriculture.",
  "objective": "To investigate the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana under microgravity and fractional gravity conditions on the International Space Station, specifically examining novel phototropic responses that are masked by Earth's gravity.",
  "methods": "Spaceflight experiments using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) on ISS with onboard centrifuges to create gravity gradients (0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, 1g). Arabidopsis genotypes (wild type, phyA, phyB mutants) were exposed to unidirectional red, blue, and red→blue light treatments with automated image analysis of curvature.",
  "results": "A novel positive blue-light phototropic response in roots was observed in microgravity, attenuated at 0.1g and absent at higher gravity levels. Red-light pretreatment enhanced blue-light phototropic curvature by 25%. Root red-light phototropism showed inverse correlation with gravity magnitude, while hypocotyl responses were gravity-independent.",
  "conclusion": "Microgravity reveals fundamental phototropic mechanisms masked by Earth's gravity, with distinct gravity thresholds for different light responses. These findings have implications for plant growth systems in space agriculture and understanding basic plant physiology.",
