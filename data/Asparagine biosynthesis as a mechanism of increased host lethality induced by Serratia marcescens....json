      "note": "Serratia marcescens exposed to LSMMG showed a dramatic 39.17-fold upregulation of the asnB gene (asparagine synthetase B), which catalyzes asparagine synthesis from aspartate and glutamine, indicating a fundamental shift in amino acid metabolism under microgravity conditions."

      "note": "The increased virulence in LSMMG-treated bacteria requires both aspartate and glutamine substrates - while aspartate alone increased bacterial growth rate, only the combination of both amino acids induced maximal asnB expression and host mortality, showing that growth rate alone doesn't determine virulence."
