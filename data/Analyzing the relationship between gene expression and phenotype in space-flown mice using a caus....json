  "title": "Analyzing the relationship between gene expression and phenotype in space-flown mice using a causal inference machine learning ensemble",
  "background": "Spaceflight negatively impacts liver function in rodents and humans, with lipid dysregulation being a common phenotype. Traditional statistical methods struggle to distinguish true correlations from spurious ones in high-dimensional spaceflight data where sample sizes are limited and randomized controlled trials are logistically challenging.",
  "objective": "To identify genes robustly correlated with lipid density phenotype in space-flown mice using causal inference machine learning methods that distinguish true biological signals from spurious correlations.",
  "methods": "Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) ensemble machine learning, using transcriptomic and histological data from NASA OSDR, with data augmentation through multiple transformations and environment string construction to exploit invariance across different data conditions.",
  "results": "CRISP identified 20 genes predictive of lipid density that were biologically relevant to NAFLD pathways, while traditional methods (DESeq2, EdgeR) and non-causal ML methods (random forest, ERM) produced less interpretable or non-significant results. Key genes included Apoc1, Apoc3, Apoe, Cyp2e1, Fasn, Scd1, and Star.",
  "conclusion": "Causal inference ML approaches can identify biologically meaningful gene-phenotype relationships in spaceflight data that traditional methods miss, providing potential biomarkers for spaceflight-induced liver dysfunction and targets for countermeasure development.",
