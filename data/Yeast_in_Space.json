  "title": "Cryptococcus albidus meningitis: A case report and literature review",
  "background": "Cryptococcus albidus (also called Naganishia albida) is a rare yeast species that causes central nervous system (CNS) infections with high mortality rates (67% for CNS infections). This fungus was first reported to infect humans in 1965 and has been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, lung abscesses, pleural fluids, and blood specimens. Fewer than 10 cases of C. albidus infection have been reported, and clinical data on appropriate antifungal treatment, particularly in obese patients, are limited.",
  "objective": "To report the first case of efficacious and safe use of ideal bodyweight to calculate liposomal-amphotericin B dose for a severely obese patient with C. albidus meningitis, and to systematically review cases of CNS infection caused by C. albidus and related species.",
  "methods": "Case report of a 25-year-old severely obese female patient (158 cm, 100 kg) treated with liposomal-amphotericin B (50 mg/day intravenously) plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g/day orally) for 6 weeks. Systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases for CNS infections attributed to C. albidus and related species.",
  "results": "The patient achieved complete resolution of symptoms with normal renal function throughout treatment. No yeast was isolated from CSF samples after 4 weeks of treatment. Literature review identified 9 cases of CNS infections caused by C. albidus or related species. Risk factors included leukemia, cancer, HIV, corticosteroid use, surgery, and animal contact. Headache was the most common symptom (present in 89% of cases). Amphotericin B was the only consistently effective antifungal agent.",
  "conclusion": "Using ideal bodyweight rather than actual bodyweight to calculate liposomal-amphotericin B dose is efficacious and safe for severely obese patients with C. albidus meningitis. Amphotericin B-based treatment should be the first choice, with subsequent therapy guided by susceptibility testing and proper species identification using molecular methods.",
