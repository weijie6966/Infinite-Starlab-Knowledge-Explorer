  "title": "A ROS-assisted calcium wave dependent on AtRBOHD and TPC1 propagates the systemic response to salt stress",
  "background": "Plants exhibit rapid systemic signaling systems that coordinate physiological responses throughout the plant body to localized environmental stresses. These signals include waves of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ traveling throughout the plant, but the mechanisms of propagation have remained unclear.",
  "objective": "To determine the mechanism of systemic Ca²⁺ wave propagation in plants in response to salt stress, specifically investigating the roles of TPC1 cation channels and AtRBOHD NADPH oxidase in ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium release.",
  "methods": "Mathematical modeling using fire-diffuse-fire framework coupled with experimental validation including confocal ratio imaging of Ca²⁺ dynamics, extracellular ROS measurement using OxyBurst Green-BSA, genetic manipulation (AtrbohD knockout, TPC1 overexpression), pharmacological inhibition (DPI, ascorbate), and quantitative PCR analysis.",
  "results": "A simple calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism mediated by TPC1 alone was insufficient to explain observed wave transmission speeds (396 ± 28 μm s⁻¹). However, a ROS-assisted CICR mechanism involving both AtRBOHD and TPC1 quantitatively reproduced experimental observations. ROS scavenging (ascorbate), NADPH oxidase inhibition (DPI), and AtrbohD knockout all significantly reduced Ca²⁺ wave speeds.",
  "conclusion": "Plant systemic signaling in response to salt stress is supported by a ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism that intimately involves ROS production by AtRBOHD and Ca²⁺ release dependent on the vacuolar channel TPC1, enabling rapid long-distance communication throughout the plant.",
