  "title": "A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host's blood cells",
  "background": "Parasitoid wasps like Leptopilina heterotoma have evolved sophisticated immune suppression mechanisms to successfully develop inside their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in their venom that contain virulence proteins capable of disrupting host cellular immunity.",
  "objective": "To understand how L. heterotoma EVs disperse within the host, enter hematopoietic cells, and suppress immune responses through both preemptive and reactive strategies.",
  "methods": "Used Drosophila genetics, cell-specific markers, antibody staining for EV localization (anti-SSp40), confocal imaging, genetic manipulation (Rab5 knockdown, PSC ablation), and analysis of endocytic trafficking pathways.",
  "results": "L. heterotoma EVs are widely distributed throughout the host's circulatory system, congregate around the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the lymph gland, disassemble the PSC, and are internalized by hematopoietic cells via Rab5-dependent endocytosis. Once inside, EVs damage late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments, leading to apoptosis of immune cells.",
  "conclusion": "Parasitoid wasps employ a multipronged approach to block host cellular immunity by simultaneously eliminating existing blood cells and tactically blocking the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation, highlighting the lymph gland's previously unrecognized phagocytic role in cellular immunity.",
