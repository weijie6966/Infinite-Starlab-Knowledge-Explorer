  "title": "A comparison of unamplified and massively multiplexed PCR amplification for murine antibody repertoire sequencing",
  "background": "Antibody repertoire sequencing is important for understanding immune responses, but most methods rely on amplification which can introduce biases. This is particularly relevant for spaceflight research where immune system changes occur due to microgravity and radiation exposure.",
  "objective": "To compare unamplified sequencing of murine antibody repertoires with commercially amplified methods to assess biases and determine the most reliable approach for immune monitoring in constrained environments.",
  "methods": "Comparison of unamplified total RNA sequencing (KSU method) with two commercial amplification methods (Com1 and Com2) using splenic RNA from C57BL/6J mice. Evaluated effects of starting material (mRNA vs total RNA), reverse transcriptase (AMV vs MMLV), and primer usage on sequencing outcomes.",
  "results": "Unamplified sequencing detected more V-gene segments (112 vs 85-100 in amplified methods) and captured 98% of high-frequency CDR3s despite lower read counts. Amplified methods showed significant biases in V-gene detection and lower correlation with unamplified data (R²=0.45-0.68).",
  "conclusion": "Unamplified RNA sequencing provides a more comprehensive view of the antibody repertoire with fewer biases, making it suitable for immune monitoring in spaceflight where accurate assessment of immune status is critical.",
