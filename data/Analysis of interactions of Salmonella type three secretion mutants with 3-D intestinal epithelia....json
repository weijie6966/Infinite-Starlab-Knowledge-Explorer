  "title": "Analysis of Interactions of Salmonella Type Three Secretion Mutants with 3-D Intestinal Epithelial Cells",
  "background": "Current understanding of Salmonella pathogenesis is based primarily on monolayer cell cultures, which lack the three-dimensional architecture and differentiation of human intestinal tissue. The prevailing paradigm states that Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium, but this conflicts with clinical observations of SPI-1 deficient strains causing human disease.",
  "objective": "To elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs using a physiologically relevant 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium that better mimics in vivo conditions.",
  "methods": "Utilized Rotating-Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor system to generate 3-D intestinal epithelial aggregates from HT-29 cells. Infected with wildtype and multiple T3SS mutants (SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-1/2 double mutant, and SPI-1/2:flhDC triple mutant). Assessed invasion, intracellular growth, and host cell targeting using gentamicin protection assays, confocal microscopy, and immunofluorescence staining.",
  "results": "Salmonella invaded 3-D intestinal cells independently of all known T3SSs, with mutants showing similar invasion levels to wildtype. Invasion was an active bacterial process, as non-invasive strains and heat-killed bacteria did not invade. T3SSs were required for substantial intracellular replication. No preferential targeting of specific intestinal cell types (M-cells, enterocytes, Paneth cells) was observed.",
  "conclusion": "T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D human intestinal epithelial cells but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of 3-D models in predicting pathogenic mechanisms.",
