  "title": "Absence of γ-sarcoglycan alters the response of p70S6 kinase to mechanical perturbation in murine skeletal muscle",
  "background": "The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) provides structural integrity at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers. Mutations in DGC components cause muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe degeneration but little contractile damage, suggesting disease occurs through aberrant signaling rather than structural deficits.",
  "objective": "To determine whether additional mechanotransduction pathways beyond ERK1/2 are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan, specifically examining p70S6K response to mechanical perturbation.",
  "methods": "Examined mechanotransduction using C2C12 myotubes, primary cultures, and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 and γ-sarcoglycan-null mice subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation determined by immunoblotting. Calcium dependence assessed using calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented solutions. mTOR dependence determined using rapamycin.",
  "results": "p70S6K is mechanically responsive in isolated muscles. Basal p70S6K activation elevated in γ-SG-/- muscles in calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both genotypes but was sustained in γ-SG-/- muscles unlike transient response in C57. Rapamycin blocked p70S6K activation in C57 but S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated in γ-SG-/- muscles.",
  "conclusion": "p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction. Loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples p70S6K response to stretch, suggesting γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where sarcoglycans are absent.",

      "note": "The study reveals that γ-sarcoglycan deficiency causes sustained p70S6K activation in response to mechanical stretch, unlike the transient response in normal muscle. After 90 minutes of passive stretch, p70S6K phosphorylation at T389 remained elevated in γ-SG-/- muscles while it returned to baseline in wild-type muscles, indicating γ-SG is crucial for pathway inactivation."

      "note": "Basal p70S6K activation was elevated 1.7-fold in resting γ-SG-/- muscles, and this elevation was calcium-independent. Unlike ERK1/2 phosphorylation differences that required calcium, p70S6K changes occurred regardless of extracellular calcium removal or intracellular calcium store inhibition with tetracaine."

Surprisingly, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated in γ-SG-/- muscles despite rapamycin treatment, suggesting alternative pathways bypass p70S6K."
