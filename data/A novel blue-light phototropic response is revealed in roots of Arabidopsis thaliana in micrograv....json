  "title": "A novel blue-light phototropic response is revealed in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana in microgravity",
  "background": "Plants use environmental cues like light and gravity for orientation and growth movements (tropisms). However, the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses is poorly understood, requiring microgravity conditions to isolate pure phototropic responses without gravity interference.",
  "objective": "To investigate the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana under microgravity and fractional gravity conditions using the International Space Station's European Modular Cultivation System.",
  "methods": "Spaceflight experiments conducted on ISS using EMCS with onboard centrifuges to create gravity gradient (0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g, 1g). Three Arabidopsis genotypes (wild type, phyA, phyB mutants) exposed to red, blue, and redâ†’blue light treatments with telemetric control from ground.",
  "results": "Discovery of novel positive blue-light phototropism in roots under microgravity, attenuated at 0.1g. Red-light pretreatment enhanced blue-light phototropic curvature by 25%. Red-light phototropic response showed inverse correlation with gravity magnitude. No significant growth differences between microgravity and 1g conditions.",
  "conclusion": "Microgravity reveals previously masked phototropic responses in plants, with different light wavelengths showing distinct gravity response thresholds, providing critical insights for plant growth in space environments.",
