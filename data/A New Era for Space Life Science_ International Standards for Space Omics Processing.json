  "title": "A New Era for Space Life Science: International Standards for Space Omics Processing",
  "background": "Space agencies are planning human missions to the Moon and Mars, but the space environment presents multiple stressors including radiation, microgravity, and isolation that affect biology. Understanding these effects is crucial for crew safety and developing countermeasures, but space omics research faces unique challenges in standardization.",
  "objective": "To establish ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an international consortium to enhance standardization guidelines for space omics experiments and maximize scientific return from limited spaceflight biological samples.",
  "methods": "Formation of international consortium with expertise across space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA), development of standardized protocols, implementation of FAIR data principles in NASA GeneLab database, and establishment of sample-sharing schemes and metadata standards.",
  "results": "ISSOP consortium established with objectives including sample-processing standardization, metadata normalization, and enhanced global collaboration. NASA GeneLab database created with over 300 space omics datasets following FAIR principles.",
  "conclusion": "International standardization through ISSOP is essential for maximizing scientific insights from precious spaceflight omics data and preparing for safe human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.",
