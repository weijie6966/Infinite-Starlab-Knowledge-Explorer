  "title": "A multi-omics longitudinal study of the murine retinal response to chronic low-dose irradiation and simulated microgravity",
  "background": "Spaceflight hazards including microgravity and space radiation can adversely affect biological systems, particularly the central nervous system and ocular function. Understanding these impacts is crucial for crew health and performance during and after missions.",
  "objective": "To assess longitudinal epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal responses to simulated spaceflight hazards (hindlimb unloading and gamma irradiation) at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months post-exposure.",
  "methods": "Multi-omics analysis of NASA GeneLab dataset using RNA-seq for transcriptomics and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) for DNA methylation, with differential expression and methylation analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and over-representation analysis.",
  "results": "Identified 4178 differentially methylated loci/regions and 457 differentially expressed genes across conditions. Nucleotide metabolism processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Wnt and Notch signaling showed alterations at 4 months post-exposure. 23 genes showed significant changes in both methylation and expression.",
  "conclusion": "Spaceflight hazard analogs induce persistent molecular changes in the retina with distinct temporal patterns, highlighting Wnt signaling and nucleotide metabolism as key pathways affected by combined radiation and microgravity exposure.",
