  "title": "A combined computational strategy of sequence and structural analysis predicts the existence of a functional eicosanoid pathway in Drosophila melanogaster",
  "background": "Eicosanoids are biologically active lipids central to mammalian immunity and inflammation, but it has been widely accepted that insects lack functional eicosanoid biosynthesis pathways. Traditional genomic analyses have failed to identify insect orthologs of most mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes, despite some evidence of prostaglandins in insect extracts.",
  "objective": "To systematically identify potential eicosanoid synthesis enzymes in Drosophila melanogaster using advanced computational approaches and challenge the current view that insects lack functional eicosanoid pathways.",
  "methods": "Comprehensive bioinformatics workflow combining sensitive sequence analysis (PSI-BLAST, DELTA-BLAST, JACKHMMER), multiple sequence alignment, domain architecture analysis, and full-length three-dimensional structural modeling using MODELLER, I-TASSER, and LOMETS. Structural validation was performed using ProSA, ProQ2, and MODFOLD4 servers.",
  "results": "Identified 20 Drosophila candidates for eicosanoid synthesis enzymes with low global sequence identity but high structural conservation. Found potential orthologs for cyclooxygenases (CG4009, CG6969, CG7660) and most prostaglandin synthesis enzymes. Structural models revealed conservation of overall folds and functional residues despite low sequence similarity.",
  "conclusion": "Drosophila melanogaster likely possesses a functional eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biosynthesis pathway, challenging current biological understanding and opening opportunities for using this model organism in inflammation research.",

The candidates shared only 20-49% sequence identity with human enzymes but showed remarkable structural conservation with RMSD values ranging from 0.523-2.942 Å when superimposed with human structures."

These candidates possessed the necessary catalytic residues (H206, Y384, H387 analogs) in similar orientations despite lacking the N-terminal EGF-like domain present in mammalian COX enzymes."

      "note": "The computational workflow combined multiple sequence analysis tools including PSI-BLAST for initial screening, DELTA-BLAST for domain-enhanced searching, and JACKHMMER for iterative profile HMM searches, demonstrating that traditional BLAST alone is insufficient for detecting evolutionarily distant homologs with conserved function but divergent sequences."

      "note": "Structural modeling revealed that Drosophila candidates maintained conservation of key functional residues despite low sequence similarity. For example, CG1742 (PTGES candidate) conserved all seven catalytic residues (R40, R71, E78, R111, Y118, R128, F132) with only a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution that maintains aromatic ring functionality."

      "id": "LN5",
      "note": "The study proposed a complete theoretical eicosanoid pathway in Drosophila including prostaglandin synthesis enzymes but noted the absence of a clear lipoxygenase ortholog. This suggests Drosophila may use alternative mechanisms for leukotriene synthesis or that lipoxygenase function is performed by unconventional enzymes not detected by current methods."

      "id": "LN6",
      "note": "Drosophila's fatty acid metabolism differs from mammals, as it lacks Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases needed to convert 18-carbon PUFAs to 20-carbon precursors. This suggests Drosophila eicosanoids may be derived from different substrates, potentially explaining the high sequence divergence of the synthetic enzymes while maintaining structural and functional conservation."

    {
      "id": "LN7",
      "note": "The computational approach successfully identified candidates even with very low sequence identity (12-18% for some enzymes) by focusing on structural conservation and functional residue preservation. This methodology could be applied to other biological systems where sequence-based methods fail to detect functional conservation across evolutionary distances."
