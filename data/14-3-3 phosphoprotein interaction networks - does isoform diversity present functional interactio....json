  "title": "14-3-3 phosphoprotein interaction networks – does isoform diversity present functional interaction specification?",
  "background": "14-3-3 proteins are major phosphoprotein interaction proteins that constitute key nodes in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, through which important signals pass. They are present in all eukaryotes and involved in protein interactions mediating signal transduction pathways, with plants having about a dozen 14-3-3 genes providing sequence and functional diversity.",
  "objective": "To examine whether 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicates functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level, and to present approaches to address the theory that functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms.",
  "methods": "Comparative analysis of 14-3-3 isoforms including sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, yeast two-hybrid studies, co-immunoprecipitation assays, subcellular localization using confocal microscopy with GFP-tagged isoforms and isoform-specific antibodies, TDNA insertion mutant analysis, and biochemical interaction assays.",
  "results": "The study found strong evidence for functional specificity among 14-3-3 isoforms, including: differential subcellular localization patterns, isoform-specific phenotypes in TDNA mutants, differential client binding affinities, and tissue-specific expression patterns. Specific isoforms showed distinct roles in processes such as photoperiodic flowering, stomatal opening, and root growth.",
  "conclusion": "True cellular and biochemical functional specificity exists among members of the 14-3-3 family, with certain isoforms having specific interactions and functions not shared with other isoforms, even when present in the same cell.",

These proteins interact with phosphorylated peptide sequences through specific motifs (RSxpSxP, RSxxpSxP, YpT) and regulate processes including red light signaling, immunity, abiotic stress response, and metabolic enzyme activity."

The ε group shows deep branching across plant species, suggesting retention of ancestral protein function, while other groups show specialization-driven divergence."

These phosphorylation sites are not universally conserved across isoforms, allowing for isoform-specific regulation and functional diversification in different cellular contexts."

Dimerization preferences can be isoform-specific, as demonstrated by 14-3-3σ preferring homodimers while 14-3-3ε prefers heterodimers, with phosphorylation status further modulating dimerization."
