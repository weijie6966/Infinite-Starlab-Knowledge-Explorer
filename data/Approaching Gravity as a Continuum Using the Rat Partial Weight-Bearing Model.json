  "title": "Approaching Gravity as a Continuum Using the Rat Partial Weight-Bearing Model",
  "background": "Spaceflight induces dramatic physiological changes including reduced muscular mass and strength, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiovascular complications. Ground-based models are necessary to understand microgravity-induced pathologies and develop countermeasures. While hindlimb unloading (HU) has been the gold-standard microgravity analog since 1979, it doesn't account for partial gravity environments like the Moon (0.16g) or Mars (0.38g).",
  "objective": "To develop and validate a rat partial weight-bearing (PWB) model that can simulate partial gravity environments and study physiological adaptations across the gravity continuum from microgravity to Earth gravity.",
  "methods": "Developed custom housing environment with polycarbonate cages and flexible perforated flooring; designed suspension apparatus with stainless-steel chains and pelvic harness; validated reliability through daily weight measurements; assessed musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and behavioral parameters; tested countermeasures like resveratrol; compared male and female responses.",
  "results": "The rat PWB model achieved precise unloading levels within ±5% error 100% of the time during 28-day experiments. Dose-dependent muscle atrophy was observed with 20-70% reductions in mechanical loading, along with linear decreases in bone mineral density. The model showed no chronic stress response and allowed seamless transitions between microgravity and partial gravity simulations.",
  "conclusion": "The rat PWB model provides a reliable ground-based analog for studying physiological adaptations to partial gravity environments, enabling research on musculoskeletal deconditioning, cardiovascular changes, and countermeasure development for lunar and Martian missions.",

      "note": "The rat PWB model achieved unprecedented precision, maintaining animals within ±5% of desired unloading levels (20%, 40%, 70% of Earth gravity) 100% of the time during 28-day experiments, representing a significant improvement over previous mouse models that only achieved this precision 77% of the time. This reliability enables confident study of dose-dependent gravity effects."

    {
      "id": "LN2",
      "note": "Musculoskeletal adaptations showed clear gravity dose-dependence: quadriceps wet mass decreased linearly with reduced loading, and trabecular bone mineral density declined proportionally to PWB level. Even 70% loading (PWB70) failed to prevent skeletal alterations, suggesting partial gravity alone may not protect against spaceflight-induced bone loss."

      "id": "LN3",
      "note": "The model's pelvic harness design eliminated chronic stress responses - plasma glucose and corticosterone levels remained normal throughout 28-day experiments, and organ masses (adrenal glands, spleen) showed no stress-related changes. This contrasts with traditional tail suspension methods that can induce stress confounds."

      "note": "Resveratrol supplementation at 150 mg/kg/day partially protected against muscle deconditioning in PWB40 (Martian gravity analog) conditions, blunting reductions in grip force and preserving myofiber cross-sectional area in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, demonstrating the model's utility for countermeasure testing."

      "note": "Female rats showed differential responses to PWB40 compared to males - they maintained body weight better and displayed delayed force deficits, with significant muscle atrophy only appearing after 14 days versus 7 days in males. This highlights the importance of studying sex-based differences for future missions with diverse crews."
