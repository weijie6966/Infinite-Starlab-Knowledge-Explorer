  "background": "SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality. Understanding the virus's intracellular mechanisms is critical for developing countermeasures, particularly for spaceflight where immune system changes and limited medical resources pose additional risks.",
  "objective": "To comprehensively review SARS-CoV-2's intracellular infection mechanisms, including viral entry, host cell hijacking, metabolic reprogramming, and immune evasion strategies relevant to understanding viral pathogenesis in constrained environments.",
  "methods": "Comprehensive literature review integrating evidence from patient samples, organoid models, cell culture studies, and animal models to elucidate SARS-CoV-2 intracellular infection mechanisms and host responses.",
  "results": "SARS-CoV-2 extensively reprograms host cell metabolism, suppresses mitochondrial function, dysregulates calcium signaling, and evades innate immune responses through multiple viral proteins that interact with host cellular machinery.",
  "conclusion": "SARS-CoV-2 employs sophisticated intracellular strategies to hijack host cell functions, with implications for understanding viral pathogenesis in spaceflight conditions where immune and metabolic systems are already stressed.",
