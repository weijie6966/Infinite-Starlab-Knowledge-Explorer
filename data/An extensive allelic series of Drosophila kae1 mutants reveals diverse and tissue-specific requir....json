  "title": "An extensive allelic series of Drosophila kae1 mutants reveals diverse and tissue-specific requirements for t6A biogenesis",
  "background": "N6-threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is a universal tRNA modification that stabilizes codon-anticodon interactions and is essential for translational fidelity. While extensively studied in single-celled organisms, its role in metazoan development and tissue-specific requirements remain poorly understood.",
  "objective": "To characterize the biological consequences of t6A loss in a metazoan system using an extensive allelic series of Drosophila kae1 mutants, the core enzyme in t6A biosynthesis.",
  "methods": "EMS mutagenesis screen, genetic complementation tests, biochemical analysis of tRNA modifications (primer extension assays, LC-MS/MS), yeast complementation assays, immunohistochemistry, clonal analysis in imaginal discs, and tissue-specific RNAi knockdown.",
  "results": "kae1 mutants showed tissue-specific requirements with complete loss of imaginal discs (highly mitotic tissues) while maintaining non-proliferating tissues for weeks. Mutants exhibited hematopoietic overgrowth, lamellocyte differentiation, melanotic tumors, and extended larval periods (up to 18 days vs normal 5 days). t6A levels decreased but were not eliminated even in null mutants.",
  "conclusion": "t6A modification exhibits tissue-specific requirements in metazoans, being essential for proliferating tissues but dispensable for many non-proliferating tissues, revealing fundamental differences in translational requirements between cell types.",
