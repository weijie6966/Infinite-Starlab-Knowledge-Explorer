  "title": "A Compact Imaging Platform for Conducting C. elegans Phenotypic Assays on Earth and in Spaceflight",
  "background": "C. elegans is used for fundamental biological studies, drug screening, disease modeling, and space-biology investigations. These applications rely on whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. Spaceflight experiments face constraints including payload size, weight, crew time, and safety requirements.",
  "objective": "To develop a compact imaging platform (CIP) integrated with a smart-device camera for whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans that addresses spaceflight constraints while maintaining research capabilities.",
  "methods": "A 3D-printed compact imaging platform was designed with no external optical elements and no mechanical focusing requirement. The system uses an iPod Touch camera with a third-party app for autofocusing and video acquisition. Validation included behavioral assays on agar plates, liquid droplets, and microfluidic chips with wild-type and mutant C. elegans strains.",
  "results": "The CIP successfully acquired phenotypic data from multiple substrates, with results consistent with literature values. Temperature control within 0.5°C was achieved. Mutant studies distinguished phenotypic differences between strains. The system demonstrated compatibility with standard image analysis software.",
  "conclusion": "The CIP is a simple, versatile, low-cost, small-footprint phenotyping tool suitable for C. elegans assays on Earth and adaptable for space biology research on the ISS after appropriate certification.",

      "note": "The Compact Imaging Platform (CIP) measures 7.5″×4.5″×5.5″, weighs ≈700g, and requires only 3W power via USB, making it suitable for ISS constraints where payload size and weight are critical factors. This represents a significant reduction compared to standard microscopy systems."

      "note": "The CIP achieved temperature control within 0.5°C of set points (15°C, 20°C, 25°C) using active cooling and ventilation slots, addressing a critical requirement for C. elegans assays where behavior is temperature-sensitive and ISS experiments require precise environmental control."
