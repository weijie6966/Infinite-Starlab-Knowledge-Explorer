  "title": "A Tissue Retrieval and Postharvest Processing Regimen for Rodent Reproductive Tissues Compatible with Long-Term Storage on the International Space Station and Postflight Biospecimen Sharing Program",
  "background": "Space flight experiments with live animals present unique challenges for tissue preservation due to remote harvesting sites, limited return opportunities, and the need to maintain tissue quality during long-term storage on ISS. The Biospecimen Sharing Program aims to maximize data return from limited flight animal payloads.",
  "objective": "To develop standardized protocols for post-euthanasia tissue harvesting and long-term storage compatible with ISS constraints, enabling recovery of high-quality RNA, protein, and histology from reproductive tissues after extended spaceflight missions.",
  "methods": "Time-course tissue degradation studies in mice and gerbils, RNAlater preservation testing, histology optimization with Bouin's fixative and ethanol substitution, protein/RNA quality assessment after long-term storage, shipping-compatible protocol development.",
  "results": "Tissue-specific harvest windows ranged 1-3 hours post-euthanasia. RNAlater preserved RNA quality when tissues were fixed within 40 minutes. Reproductive tissues maintained high-quality RNA and protein after 10 months at -80°C. Stepwise ethanol-PBS-ethanol transitions preserved histology better than rapid transitions.",
  "conclusion": "Developed comprehensive tissue processing protocols compatible with ISS long-term storage and multi-investigator biospecimen sharing, enabling optimal preservation of spaceflight biological effects in rodent reproductive tissues.",

      "note": "The study established species- and tissue-specific harvest windows: mouse testes maintain histology for 3 hours post-euthanasia, while gerbil ovaries degrade significantly after 1.5 hours, showing vacuolization and tissue fragility. This enables prioritization of harvest sequence in multi-investigator scenarios."
