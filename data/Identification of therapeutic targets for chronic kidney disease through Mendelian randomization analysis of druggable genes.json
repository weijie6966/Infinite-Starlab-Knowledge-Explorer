  "title": "Identification of therapeutic targets for chronic kidney disease through Mendelian randomization analysis of druggable genes",
  "background": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition affecting over 800 million individuals globally, characterized by complex pathogenesis and limited therapeutic options. The identification of novel drug targets is crucial for improving treatment outcomes.",
  "objective": "To identify and explore novel drug targets for CKD using Mendelian randomization analysis of druggable genes to elucidate causal relationships between gene expression and CKD risk.",
  "methods": "Mendelian randomization analysis using cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) as instrumental variables, with CKD genome-wide association study data from FinnGen database (11,265 cases, 436,208 controls). Additional analyses included Gene Ontology, KEGG enrichment, and colocalization analysis.",
  "results": "Twelve genes showed significant association with CKD risk after false discovery rate correction. TUBB demonstrated the strongest evidence as a potential therapeutic target with colocalization probability of 97.27%. Enrichment analyses revealed these genes are involved in MAP kinase activity regulation, platelet activation, and gap junction pathways.",
  "conclusion": "TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for CKD treatment based on compelling statistical evidence from MR and colocalization analyses.",
