  "title": "Adaptive Changes in the Vestibular System of Land Snail to a 30-Day Spaceflight and Readaptation on Return to Earth",
  "background": "The vestibular system receives permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. This study investigates whether sensory systems adapt to abrupt loss of gravitational force during spaceflight, using land snails as a model organism.",
  "objective": "To identify adaptive changes in the vestibular system at behavioral, structural, molecular, and neurophysiological levels following 30-day spaceflight exposure and subsequent readaptation to Earth gravity.",
  "methods": "Land snails (Helix lucorum) were exposed to 30 days of microgravity aboard Bion-M1 satellite. Postflight analysis included geotactic behavior assessment, statocyst transcriptome analysis via RNA-Seq, SEM imaging of statoconia, and electrophysiological recordings of mechanoreceptor responses to tilt stimuli. Multiple control groups accounted for habitat factors.",
  "results": "Spaceflight induced plastic changes in the snail vestibular system: postflight snails showed shortened T0 phase latency in gravitaxis, reduced tentacle withdrawal, and increased statocyst sensitivity to tilt stimuli. Transcriptome analysis revealed 3,544 differentially expressed genes. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 hours post-landing. No changes in statoconia mass or structure were detected.",
  "conclusion": "Despite gravity's evolutionary permanence, the snail vestibular system demonstrates compensatory plasticity to microgravity exposure and rapid readaptation upon return to Earth gravity, providing insights into neural adaptation mechanisms relevant to spaceflight.",
