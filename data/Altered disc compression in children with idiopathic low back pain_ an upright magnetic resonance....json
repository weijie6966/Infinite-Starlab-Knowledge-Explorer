  "title": "Altered Disc Compression in Children with Idiopathic Low Back Pain: An Upright MRI Backpack Study",
  "background": "Low back pain affects 24-37% of schoolchildren, with backpack use being a significant contributing factor. Over 92% of US children carry backpacks weighing 10-22% of body weight, and 82% of children with low back pain attribute it to backpack use. Previous research shows backpack loads compress lumbar discs and increase pain in normal children.",
  "objective": "To analyze the lumbar spine's response to common backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) using upright MRI and compare results to previously published normal child data under identical conditions.",
  "methods": "Repeated measures design using 0.6T upright MRI scanner to image 15 pediatric patients with ILBP while supine and standing with 0kg, 4kg, and 8kg backpacks. Measured IVD height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain scores using standardized protocols and statistical analysis including ANOVAs and generalized least squares models.",
  "results": "ILBP children experienced disc compression only at L5-S1 (9.8-9.9% compression with 4-8kg loads) compared to normal children who showed compression across all lumbar discs. ILBP children had significantly less disc compression at T12-L1 to L4-5, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain with increasing loads. They could not tolerate 12kg loads due to pain.",
  "conclusion": "ILBP children demonstrate altered load tolerance mechanisms, potentially distributing backpack loads to paraspinal musculature rather than intervertebral discs, leading to increased pain through muscle fatigue rather than structural compression.",

      "note": "Children with idiopathic low back pain demonstrate fundamentally different spinal loading patterns compared to normal children, compressing only the L5-S1 disc (9.8-9.9% with 4-8kg loads) versus multiple levels in healthy subjects. This suggests altered load distribution mechanisms that could inform astronaut spinal health during spaceflight."

This approach provides more physiologically relevant data for understanding spinal mechanics under load."

This has implications for understanding spaceflight-related back pain."
