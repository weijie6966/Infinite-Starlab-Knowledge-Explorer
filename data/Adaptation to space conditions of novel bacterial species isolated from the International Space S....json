      "note": "The study identified 74-309 unique gene annotations across five novel ISS bacterial species that were absent in their closest Earth relatives, demonstrating significant genetic adaptation to the space environment. These adaptations included novel biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites and enhanced DNA repair systems, with the extent of genetic differences correlating with phylogenetic distance from Earth counterparts."

      "note": "The research employed DeepFRI, a deep learning-based annotation tool that achieved nearly 100% coverage of protein-coding genes, overcoming limitations of traditional homology-based tools like PGAP and eggNOG. This AI approach enabled identification of novel membrane-associated proteins and biosynthetic clusters that were previously categorized as 'hypothetical' proteins."

      "note": "Mobile genetic elements including transposases and plasmid-related genes were detected in ISS strains, with the spore-forming Paenibacillus vandeheii showing the highest abundance. These elements suggest horizontal gene transfer may contribute to rapid adaptation, though transposable elements were not universally present across all ISS species."
