  "title": "Articular cartilage and sternal fibrocartilage respond differently to extended microgravity",
  "background": "The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous tissues are largely unknown compared to well-studied bone and muscle responses. Articular cartilage has poor regenerative capacity, making microgravity-induced damage potentially mission-critical for crew mobility and long-term health.",
  "objective": "To investigate pathological changes in articular cartilage and sternal fibrocartilage from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 spacecraft",
  "methods": "Histological analysis (toluidine blue, Safranin-O, collagen II staining), electron microscopy, microarray gene expression profiling of cartilage tissues from mice flown on BION-M1 mission compared to ground controls",
  "results": "Articular cartilage showed proteoglycan loss, surface damage, osteophyte formation, and downregulation of 37 genes including structural ECM components. Sternal cartilage showed no proteoglycan loss and downregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes MMP13 and MMP9. Histological scores were significantly worse in spaceflight articular cartilage.",
  "conclusion": "Weight-bearing articular cartilage is negatively affected by microgravity unloading, while minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage is protected. Maintenance of physiological loading during spaceflight may minimize articular cartilage damage.",

      "note": "Articular cartilage from spaceflight mice showed significant proteoglycan loss primarily in femoral condyles, with approximately 35% of chondrocytes in affected areas showing pericellular proteoglycan staining. This tissue-level degradation suggests early-stage cartilage breakdown occurs within 30 days of microgravity exposure, potentially compromising joint function."

      "note": "Gene expression analysis revealed 37 genes were downregulated more than two-fold in flight articular cartilage, including nine structural ECM components (fmod, Ogn, Omd, Dcn, Dpt, Prelp, Col10a1, Tsp4, COMP) and the chondroprotective lubricin gene Prg4. This molecular profile indicates reduced matrix production and loss of protective mechanisms."

      "note": "Sternal fibrocartilage showed no proteoglycan loss and actually downregulated matrix-degrading enzymes MMP13 and MMP9, suggesting protection from microgravity effects. The continued respiratory loading in microgravity may maintain sternal cartilage homeostasis, highlighting the importance of mechanical loading differences."

      "note": "Spaceflight articular cartilage had significantly worse histological scores compared to all ground control groups (GC, GCV, SFV), with evidence of surface damage, osteophyte formation in three samples, and one sample showing <2/3 normal thickness. These structural changes could impact crew mobility during extended missions."
