  "title": "ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth",
  "background": "Annexins are calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Arabidopsis annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are highly expressed in seedlings and are involved in various stress responses, but their specific functions in phloem transport and root development were not well understood.",
  "objective": "To investigate the roles of ANN1 and ANN2 in post-phloem sugar transport to root tips and their effects on primary root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana.",
  "methods": "Used ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants (ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, ann1-2/ann2-1) and overexpression lines; measured root growth under different sugar conditions; performed Lugol staining for starch detection; RNA-seq and RT-qPCR for gene expression; GC/MS for sugar quantification; CFDA tracing for phloem transport; H2DCFDA staining for ROS detection; aniline blue staining for callose accumulation.",
  "results": "ANN1/ANN2 knockout mutants showed impaired primary root growth and root cap development when grown without sucrose, which was rescued by exogenous sugars. Mutants had higher soluble sugar content in roots but impaired post-phloem transport to root tips. Increased ROS and callose accumulation were observed in mutant root tips, along with upregulation of photosynthetic genes in cotyledons.",
  "conclusion": "ANN1 and ANN2 facilitate post-phloem sugar transport to root tips by regulating ROS levels and callose deposition at plasmodesmata, thereby influencing primary root growth and photosynthetic regulation in leaves.",

This transport defect was rescued in ANN1-overexpressing lines, which showed 50% increased diffusion, demonstrating annexins' critical role in sugar delivery to growing root regions."

      "note": "Mutants accumulated significantly higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and callose in root tips when grown without sucrose. Callose deposition at plasmodesmata restricts symplastic transport, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed sugar transport defects in annexin-deficient plants."

      "id": "LN3",
      "note": "Despite having higher overall soluble sugar content in roots (measured by GC/MS), ann mutants showed symptoms of sugar starvation in root tips, indicating localized nutrient deficiency despite systemic sufficiency. This paradox highlights the importance of distribution efficiency over total accumulation."

      "note": "Root-to-shoot communication was evidenced by upregulation of photosynthetic genes (CAB2, CAB3, LHB1B1, LHB1B2) and increased chlorophyll accumulation in mutant cotyledons, suggesting that sugar-starved root tips signal leaves to enhance photosynthesis as a compensatory mechanism."

    {
      "id": "LN5",
      "note": "All root growth and developmental defects in ann mutants were rescued by exogenous sucrose, glucose, or fructose, but not by osmotic controls like mannitol, confirming that the phenotypes result from sugar-specific transport defects rather than general osmotic or developmental problems."
