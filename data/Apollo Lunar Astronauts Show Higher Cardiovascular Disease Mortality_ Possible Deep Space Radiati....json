  "title": "Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium",
  "background": "As spacefaring nations plan extended missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks increase when traveling beyond Earth's protective magnetosphere into intense deep space radiation environments. Previous epidemiological studies on radiation risks largely derived from low-LET radiation exposures, with limited attention to the long-term effects of space radiation on cardiovascular health.",
  "objective": "To determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease differ between non-flight astronauts, low Earth orbit astronauts, and Apollo lunar astronauts, and to investigate the mechanistic basis through animal studies of simulated space radiation effects on vascular function.",
  "methods": "Retrospective analysis of astronaut mortality data through 2015, comparing non-flight astronauts (n=35), LEO astronauts (n=35), and Apollo lunar astronauts (n=7). Animal studies used C57BL/6 mice exposed to hindlimb unloading (14 days), 1 Gy 56Fe ion irradiation, or both, with vascular function assessed 6-7 months post-treatment.",
  "results": "CVD mortality rate was 43% in Apollo lunar astronauts compared to 9% in non-flight and 11% in LEO astronauts. Animal studies showed that space-relevant irradiation induced sustained vascular endothelial dysfunction mediated through impaired NO signaling and increased oxidative stress via xanthine oxidase upregulation.",
  "conclusion": "Deep space travel beyond Earth's magnetosphere is associated with significantly higher cardiovascular disease mortality, likely due to space radiation-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction that persists long-term and may contribute to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease development.",
