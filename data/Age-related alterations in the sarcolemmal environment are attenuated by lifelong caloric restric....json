  "title": "Age-related alterations in the sarcolemmal environment are attenuated by lifelong caloric restriction and voluntary exercise",
  "background": "Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) affects up to 25% of humans aged 65+ and over 40% of those ≥80 years old. Sarcopenia increases susceptibility to fatigue, weakness, and fall-related injuries, with compromised sarcolemmal integrity contributing to muscle deterioration.",
  "objective": "To determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and CR plus voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate age-related disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins, maintaining a healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers.",
  "methods": "Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% CR (OCR); 24-month old 8% CR + WR (OCRWR); and 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL). Analysis included histochemical staining, immunohistochemistry for DGC proteins, western blot analysis of membrane repair proteins and Nox2 subunits, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area measurements.",
  "results": "Aging caused discontinuous membrane expression of DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, nNOS) and decreased Nox2 subunits. Membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, A2) significantly increased in OAL. Lifelong CR and CRWR protected against DGC disruption, maintained membrane repair proteins near YAL levels, and prevented Nox2 subunit loss. Both interventions partially prevented age-related decrease in fiber cross-sectional area.",
  "conclusion": "Lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary exercise are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment, potentially preventing sarcopenia progression and maintaining muscle quality.",
