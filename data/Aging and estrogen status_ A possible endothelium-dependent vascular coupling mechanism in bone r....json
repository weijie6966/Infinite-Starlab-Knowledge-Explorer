  "title": "Aging and Estrogen Status: A Possible Endothelium-Dependent Vascular Coupling Mechanism in Bone Remodeling",
  "background": "Bone loss with aging and menopause may be linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction. Estrogen deficiency is known to cause osteoporosis, but the mechanisms may involve vascular effects beyond direct bone cell activity.",
  "objective": "To determine whether modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of femoral principal nutrient arteries are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume with altered estrogen status in young and old female rats.",
  "methods": "In vitro assessment of PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation using acetylcholine, microCT analysis of trabecular bone volume, and pharmacological inhibition of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase pathways in young (6 month) and old (24 month) Fischer-344 rats with ovariectomy and estrogen replacement.",
  "results": "Estrogen status significantly affected both vascular function and bone volume. In young rats, ovariectomy reduced vasodilation from 82% to 61% and bone volume from 28.7% to 16.3%, while estrogen replacement restored both parameters. In old rats, estrogen replacement enhanced vasodilation from 55% to 92% and bone volume from 33.1% to 42.4%.",
  "conclusion": "Estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume, indicating a possible vascular coupling mechanism in bone remodeling that could have implications for spaceflight-induced bone loss.",
