  "title": "A member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family is a putative regulator of reactive oxygen species homeostasis and spaceflight physiological adaptation",
  "background": "Plants must adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight, which includes microgravity, radiation, and altered convection. Understanding how plants adjust to conditions outside their evolutionary experience is crucial for space exploration and provides insights into terrestrial plant biology.",
  "objective": "To investigate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in spaceflight acclimation and characterize a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) identified from spaceflight transcriptomes.",
  "methods": "ROSMETER analysis of spaceflight transcriptomes, qRT-PCR, histochemical GUS staining, fluorescent ROS assays (DCF-DA and luminol-based), phylogenetic analysis, subcellular localization studies, and transgenic plant approaches.",
  "results": "OMG1 was consistently induced in spaceflight in WS ecotype but not Col-0. OMG1 regulates ROS production and expression of ROS-associated genes MYB77 and GRX480. It belongs to the CONSTANS-Like protein family but has divergent B-box domains. OMG1 localizes to the nucleus and is rapidly induced upon wounding.",
  "conclusion": "OMG1 is a CCT domain transcriptional regulator of ROS homeostasis important for physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments reveal novel gene functions, and ROS homeostasis plays a crucial role in plant adaptation to space environments.",
