  "title": "Artificial Gravity Attenuates the Transcriptomic Response to Spaceflight in the Optic Nerve and Retina",
  "background": "Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is a serious concern for astronauts during deep space missions, characterized by physiological and pathological neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities including optic disc edema, globe flattening, and retinal changes.",
  "objective": "Evaluate whether artificial gravity (AG) could mitigate the deleterious effects of microgravity on the retina and optic nerve during spaceflight, and compare the effectiveness of different AG levels (0.33 G, 0.67 G, 1 G).",
  "methods": "RNA sequencing of optic nerve and retinal tissue from mice exposed to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity (0.33 G, 0.67 G, 1 G) during a 30-day International Space Station mission, with habitat ground controls. Immunofluorescence for oxidative stress biomarker 4-HNE.",
  "results": "Spaceflight induced transcriptomic changes consistent with increased oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Artificial gravity attenuated these changes in a dose-dependent manner, with 1 G providing the strongest attenuation. 4-HNE staining confirmed oxidative stress reduction at 0.67 G and 1 G.",
  "conclusion": "Adding artificial gravity by centrifugation on board the ISS, especially near 1 G, can significantly reduce transcriptomic alteration induced by spaceflight in ocular tissue, potentially mitigating spaceflight-induced detrimental effects.",
