  "title": "A method for preparing spaceflight RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis thaliana tissue for scanning electron microscopy",
  "background": "Spaceflight experiments face severe constraints including limited up-mass, crew time, and orbital resources, forcing researchers to choose between molecular and morphological analyses due to different fixation requirements. RNAlater is commonly used for molecular studies but not typically for morphological work.",
  "objective": "To develop a protocol enabling SEM-based morphometric investigation of RNAlater-fixed tissues to maximize scientific return from spaceflight samples by allowing both molecular and morphological analyses from the same fixation method.",
  "methods": "RNAlater-fixed samples were desalinated in distilled water, dehydrated through graded methanol, plunged into liquid ethane, transferred to cryovials for freeze-substitution, critical point dried, mounted, sputter-coated, and imaged using SEM.",
  "results": "The protocol produced acceptable SEM images from RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis thaliana tissue with minimal tissue damage. Most tissues remained intact, preserving general morphology and finer details including root hairs and trichomes in both spaceflight and ground control samples.",
  "conclusion": "This protocol successfully enables SEM imaging of RNAlater-fixed tissues, providing distinct advantages for spaceflight and field studies by allowing dual molecular and morphological analysis from a single fixation method, maximizing data return from limited biological samples.",
