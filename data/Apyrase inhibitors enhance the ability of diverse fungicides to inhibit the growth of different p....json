  "title": "Apyrase inhibitors enhance the ability of diverse fungicides to inhibit the growth of different plant-pathogenic fungi",
  "background": "Fungal pathogens cause devastating crop losses worldwide, and fungicide resistance mediated by ABC transporter efflux mechanisms limits fungicide effectiveness. Previous research showed apyrase inhibitors increase plant sensitivity to herbicides by inhibiting ABC transporter activity.",
  "objective": "To determine whether four specific apyrase inhibitors enhance the potency of commonly available fungicides against several plant-pathogenic fungal species",
  "methods": "Plate growth assays with five pathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum graminicola, Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Verticillium dahliae) treated with three fungicides (copper octanoate, myclobutanil, propiconazole) combined with four apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13, AI.15); mass spectrometry for fungicide retention; apyrase activity assays; extracellular ATP measurements",
  "results": "Apyrase inhibitors significantly enhanced fungicide potency in 53 of 60 treatment combinations. Inhibitors increased propiconazole retention 2-fold in three fungal species. AI.1 and AI.13 inhibited fungal apyrase activity by 33-96%. Extracellular ATP increased with apyrase inhibition. Field trials showed AI.1 enhanced tebuconazole effectiveness by >50%.",
  "conclusion": "Apyrase inhibitors enhance fungicide potency by increasing intracellular fungicide retention, likely through disruption of ATP-driven efflux transporters, offering potential for more effective fungal control in agricultural systems.",

      "note": "Apyrase inhibitors significantly enhanced fungicide effectiveness across five different pathogenic fungi, with 53 out of 60 treatment combinations showing statistically significant improvement. The most dramatic effects were seen with copper octanoate, where inhibitors increased growth inhibition by up to 22% compared to fungicide alone."

      "id": "LN2",
      "note": "Mass spectrometry revealed that apyrase inhibitors caused a 2-fold increase in propiconazole retention inside fungal cells, suggesting they work by blocking efflux transporter activity. This mechanism parallels how these inhibitors enhance herbicide effectiveness in plants by inhibiting ABCB transporters."

      "note": "The inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 directly suppressed fungal apyrase activity by 33-96% in extracts from B. cinerea and F. oxysporum. Apyrase inhibition led to increased extracellular ATP concentrations, which may disrupt the ATP gradient needed for efflux transporter function."

      "note": "Field trial data (not fully reported) indicated that AI.1 enhanced tebuconazole effectiveness by more than 50% in controlling fungal growth on wheat seeds, demonstrating practical agricultural potential. The inhibitors themselves had no negative effects on plant growth at effective concentrations."

      "note": "The study tested four chemically distinct apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13, AI.15) with different specificities, showing that multiple chemical scaffolds can achieve similar enhancement effects. This suggests robustness in the approach and potential for optimization of inhibitor properties."

      "note": "Phylogenetic analysis revealed diversity in fungal apyrase sequences, with C. graminicola and V. dahliae apyrases clustering together while B. cinerea, F. oxysporum and S. sclerotiorum apyrases were more divergent, yet all responded to the inhibitors."

    {
      "id": "LN7",
      "note": "Unlike in plants, externally applied ATP or ATPÎ³S did not enhance fungicide effectiveness, likely due to the hydrophobic fungal cell wall preventing penetration. This highlights the advantage of using hydrophobic apyrase inhibitors that can penetrate fungal structures."
