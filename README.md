# üåå Infinite Starlab Knowledge Explorer

Infinite Starlab Knowledge Explorer is a platform designed to make NASA's decades of space biology research more accessible and actionable. While over 600 publications exist, the information is scattered across studies, highly technical, and challenging for researchers to navigate efficiently.

This innovative platform transforms these publications into a structured knowledge base presented through an interactive knowledge graph, bridging the gap between raw scientific literature and usable insights to support faster discovery, clearer communication, and more informed decision-making for future human missions to the Moon and Mars.

## üî¨ How It Works

The platform transforms NASA's space biology publications into a structured knowledge base presented through an interactive knowledge graph. Users can:

- **Search and Filter Studies**: Find research by keywords, topics, or research themes across 600+ publications
- **Explore Visual Connections**: Navigate through graph connections that reveal relationships among experiments
- **Access AI-Powered Summaries**: Get concise, understandable insights from complex technical sections
- **Identify Research Patterns**: Discover connections and gaps across studies, revealing hidden patterns that may otherwise remain unnoticed

## üéØ Benefits

This approach significantly reduces the time required to sift through dense technical literature and makes complex results easier to interpret. The platform enables:

- **Scientists**: Focus on generating new hypotheses rather than literature review
- **Research Managers**: Identify research opportunities and funding priorities
- **Mission Planners**: Better understand biological responses in space environments
- **Decision Makers**: Access clear, actionable insights from complex research data

## üöÄ Intended Impact

The project bridges the gap between raw scientific literature and usable insights. By organizing and simplifying vast amounts of data, it supports faster discovery, clearer communication, and more informed decision-making. Ultimately, the platform provides critical knowledge that will aid the safe and effective planning of future human missions to the Moon and Mars.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.7+** - For running the local web server
2. **Ollama** - **REQUIRED** for AI chatbot functionality. The platform cannot run without Ollama as it powers the AI-powered summaries and intelligent features.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Infinite-Starlab-Knowledge-Explorer"
   ```
   
   Or simply download and extract the project files to your desired directory.

2. **Install Ollama (REQUIRED)**
   
   Ollama is essential for the AI chatbot functionality:
   - Visit [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) and download for your platform
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
   - Ensure Ollama is properly installed and accessible from command line

3. **Download the AI Model (REQUIRED)**
   ```bash
   ollama run deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud
   ```
   
   This command will download and run the DeepSeek AI model that powers the platform's intelligent features including AI-powered summaries and chatbot functionality.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Web Server**
   
   Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   
   This will start a local web server on port 8000.

2. **Access the Application**
   
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   
   You should see the Infinite Starlab Knowledge Explorer homepage with the beautiful space-themed interface.

3. **Start Ollama (REQUIRED for AI Features)**
   
   To enable AI-powered summaries and chatbot functionality, run in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   ollama run deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud
   ```
   
   **Note**: Keep this terminal running while using the platform. Without Ollama running, the AI chatbot and intelligent summarization features will not work.
